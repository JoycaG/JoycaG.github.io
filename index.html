									<h2><a href="#">I make companies GROW</a></h2>
									<p>My goal is to make companies grow and keep costs low, while effectively reaching the target customer with creative online and offline marketing techniques. I am a fluent multilingual of 4 languages - English, Dutch, French and Spanish. I aim to use my communication skills, my analytical SEO, SEM and SEA tactics to reach customers from all over the world.<br />

										<h2><a href="#">Website<br />
										Content</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic06.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>I manage content on websites such as wordpress, keeping in mind that it could be the visitor's first contact with the brand. With strategic promotion of the website, I drive trafic with the goal to attract people who may be interested to purchase the products or services. Furthermore, I use SEM strategies to rank highly on the seach result pages. The right SEO tactics, content marketing and online/offline efforts are also implemented.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">Email<br />
										Marketing</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Email marketing is a great way to help a business grow. With email newsletters such as Mailchimp (see sample) it is an easy way to inform the selected audience of new products, special discounts or other services. I keep the audience engaged between purchases and make sure they stay alert so that the company can retain that customer and build a long term customer relationship. </p>

										<h2><a href="#">Print<br />
										Marketing</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>I have experience with marketing content for print such as magazines, brochures and flyers since many consumers retain information easier in print format. The advertised products and services are available online as well, however, a printed copy can be highly effective as it helps build the identity of the brand if done with good quality materials. There are various ways of achieving results by keeping costs low. </p>

									<h2><a href="#">Professional<br />
										Presentations</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic07.jpg" alt="" /></a>
							<p>Presentations are key when proposing marketing plans, campaigns, social media strategies and a way to compile information of a new product/service for marketing collaborations. With the use of PDF, Word, Powerpoint, Excel, Google slides, or Prezi presentations and the right amount of content, I improve marketing ROI, while keeping the audience engaged in the meeting. </p>

										<h2><a href="#">Social Media<br />
										Marketing</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Social media is the ideal tool for efficient and cost effective marketing. With up-to-date, relevant and engaging content the audience will surely interact with the content, which will boost sales. The posts I have produced are written posts that include images, videos, stories and Live content. The content I produce is either educational, inspirational, interactive, connecting, promotional, newsworthy or entertaining. Over 97% of marketers use social media to reach their audience so this is a must!</p>

									<p>Through branding and ROI based PPC campaigns, I generate leads using SEO, SEM and SEA digital marketing skills. With my experience, I can create successful Ad campaigns on platforms such as facebook, instagram, TikTok and Google. </p>
